    <h2 class="heading1">What is CSS ?</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper.or in other media.</li>
        <li>
           <b line-through>Css is not necessary.</b>
        <span class="span">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can cantrol the layout of multiple web page all at once</li>
        <li class="anchor">External stylesheets are stored in css files.</li>
     </ol>

     <h2 class="heading">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways :</h2>
       <ul class="letter">
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in thr head section.</li>
        <li> External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most comman way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in  external CSS files.However,<span class="span"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrare, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
       </ul>
<p>Whe comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique elemnt.ID is also special is that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.       
</p>
<p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific elemnt or range of an element on web page.Once an elemnt has brrn targeted,a style or set can be applied to the element.</p>

<p>
    There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commanly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elemnts to whuch a style should be applied.
